** DISLAIMER** 

Fano has every right to deny you a skin if you are not somewhat a known name in the community. Make sure you interact and chat within the community and not just lurk to gain points and redeem at the end.

The store will be updated RANDOMLY ~once every week, but this will vary. Do not ask when the store will be restocked or you may be timed out.

If you are found with multiple accounts, you may be permanently banned from redeeming any items on any accounts.

If you do not get points from hype trains etc. then make sure you are logged into streamelements. No points will be added from not getting points from bonuses.
